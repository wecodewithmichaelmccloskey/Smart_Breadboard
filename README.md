### Project Description:
The Smart Breadboard is an interactive alternative way to build circuits. Users will be able to learn the underlying fundamentals of circuitry via the rows 
and columns just like in a standard breadboard. The Smart Breadboard reduces any confusion in constructing circuits by providing the user step by step 
instructions on how to connect all parts of a desired circuit. The user is able to tell the Smart Breadboard the desired type of circuit that will be built 
via RFID tags. The Smart Breadboard displays instructions on constructing a circuit with an interactive control menu. The user is able to measure voltage, 
resistance and current at any point in the circuit using the built in digital multimeter on the board. The Smart Breadboard also allows users to receive 
visual feedback to see if the circuit is connected properly.

### Project Inspiration:
Learning how to build circuits is a topic many seek to learn. Some simply purchase a breadboard, a few resistors, LED's, transistors, etc. to get started. 
Once the materials are in some find themselves eager to build right away. There are online tutorials on how to build certain circuits, but that's about it. There's no clear background to why the circuit works the way it does especially for a first time electronics learner. Let alone there is probably no background on how a breadboard and its connection works. 

In recent years, with an increased investment in engineering, as both a prospective career and educational path, many parents have demonstrated an interest in engaging their children in activities that could foster an interest in these fields. Looking into anecdotes from parents online, electrical engineering was a popular choice for parents to get their kids to engage in engineering. Working with circuits and electronic components was viewed by parents as a way to “introduce electronics to myself and my kids in a fun lab/project oriented way” (https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/12886/looking-for-a-fun-way-to-introduce-basic-electronics-to-my-kids).

However, parents faced two main issues. First, a knowledge gap existed in the various engineering principles necessary to teach kids how to work with circuits. One parent stated that they knew “very little about circuits and didn't even know what a breadboard was" (https://www.reddit.com/r/breadboard/comments/1j95vk/want_to_get_into_electronics_no_idea_where_to/). Another parent stated that just having circuit building equipment “doesn't do much good without some type of instructional book” to help guide their child through how circuits are constructed [(Reddit, u/0not, 2015)](https://www.reddit.com/r/electronics/comments/3ijqpp/looking_for_general_purpose_electronic_kits_for/). A second issue arose when it came to actually building circuits and kids working with circuit building equipment. Parents stated that “breadboards are difficult [for young kids]” because “the holes are close together” ([Arduino, Alex K, 2016](https://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/21372/breadboard-for-kids)). Other parents with breadboard alternatives, while evading this confusion in using breadboard, still resulted in kids being confused with “wiring [being] difficult” with both breadboard and breadboard alternatives ([Arduino, Paul, 2016](https://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/21372/breadboard-for-kids)).

In order to address the issue of the knowledge gap and technical confusion for kids engaging in a hands-on activity to begin developing their interest in electronics, a solution is provided with the Smart Breadboard. The Smart Breadboard is designed with the assumption of the user having very little experience of using circuits and circuit building equipment, providing building and debugging assistance during this initial stage of exploration into electronics. 

The Smart Breadboard is intended to be used as follows: First, the user, assumed to have no prior knowledge of circuits, chooses from a provided set of simple circuits, ranging from voltage divider to LED circuits and more. The user chooses the appropriate card for the circuit they wish to build, and scans it on the Smart Breadboard. The Smart Breadboard, based on the user’s chosen circuit, will display instructions for the user to build the circuit, provide the user tools to test the circuit, and a guide for debugging in case of performance discrepancies.

The Smart Breadboard will help users learn the ins and out of circuitry and how node connections work on a breadboard. The Smart Breadboard is ideal for beginners learning about electronics to anyone who wants to get a refresher on their knowledge of circuitry.
