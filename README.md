### Project Description:
The Smart Breadboard is an interactive alternative way to build circuits. Users will be able to learn the underlying fundamentals of circuitry via the rows 
and columns just like in a standard breadboard. The Smart Breadboard reduces any confusion in constructing circuits by providing the user step by step 
instructions on how to connect all parts of a desired circuit. The user is able to tell the Smart Breadboard the desired type of circuit that will be built 
via RFID tags. The Smart Breadboard displays instructions on constructing a circuit with an interactive control menu. The user is able to measure voltage, 
resistance and current at any point in the circuit using the built in digital multimeter on the board. The Smart Breadboard also allows users to receive 
visual feedback to see if the circuit is connected properly.
