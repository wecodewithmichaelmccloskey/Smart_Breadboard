1, Sample Circuit, LED: 1^ 2: led.jpg: Make sure the anode (longer leg) is in Node 2; Switch: 3^ 4^ 5: switch.jpg: ; 470 Ohm resistor: 2^ 4: resistor470.jpg: ; jumper wire: 5^ 0: jumper.jpg: ; jumper wire: 1^ 0: jumper.jpg: ; jumper wire: 3^ 10: jumper.jpg: , Move the switch toward Node 5/, the LED should be off. Measure the voltage from Node 2 to Node 4.: 0 : 20 ; Move the switch toward Node 3/, the LED should be on. Measure the voltage from Node 2 to Node 4.: 1300 : 1500
