2, RGB Circuit, RGB LED: 1^ 2^ 3^ 0: rgb_led.jpg: The ground terminal is color coded in blue; 220 ohm resistor: 1: resistor220.jpg: Leave the other end disconnected for now; 220 ohm resistor: 2: resistor220.jpg: Leave the other end disconnected for now; 220 ohm resistor: 3: resistor220.jpg: Leave the other end disconnected for now; Power wires: 0^ 10: power.jpg: Be careful to connect red to positive and black to ground. These are live wires.; 220 ohm resistor: 10: resistor220.jpg: To mix colors connect the ends of the resistors to the positive terminal, Press voltage measuring leads to Node 1 and the positive terminal: 1 : 1300: 1500: 1400; Press voltage measuring leads to Node 2 and the positive terminal: 1 : 1300: 1500: 1400; Press voltage measuring leads to Node 3 and the positive terminal: 1 : 1300: 1500: 1400, Did you connect the loose ends of the resistors to an existing node?: Did you properly connect the ground pin of the RGB LED?; Did you accidently connect the loose ends of the resistors to an existing node?: Did you properly connect the ground pin of the RGB LED?; Did you accidently connect the loose ends of the resistors to an existing node?: Did you properly connect the ground pin of the RGB LED?
